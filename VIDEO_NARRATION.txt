CONFIDENTIAL CAREER PLANNING - VIDEO NARRATION

==========================================================

Introducing Confidential Career Planning - a privacy-first career assessment system built with FHEVM.

Career planning involves sensitive information - your goals, skills, and education priorities. Traditional systems expose all of this to platforms and counselors.

With FHEVM, users submit encrypted assessments using ebool and euint8 types. The smart contract calculates guidance scores entirely in the encrypted domain - never seeing the actual data.

The contract uses FHE-dot-select for conditional logic and FHE-dot-add for arithmetic. All calculations happen on encrypted values. The result is a guidance score from zero to one hundred - computed privately on-chain.

Users connect their wallet, submit encrypted assessments, and retrieve personalized guidance - all while maintaining complete privacy. The system is live on Sepolia testnet.

Complete with comprehensive tests, documentation at multiple levels, and deployment scripts. Start building privacy-preserving applications with FHEVM today.
